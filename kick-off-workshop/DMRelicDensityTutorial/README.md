# Relic density calculation tutorial 

This tutorial is intended as an introduction to scientific computing in python. This is done through a basic calculation of the thermal freeze out of a WIMP. 

The notebook acts as an example of how to layout a clear and reproducible calculation which can be shared online. 

There are two notebooks: a 'skeleton' with the solutions removed, and a 'solutions' notebook with the answers included.

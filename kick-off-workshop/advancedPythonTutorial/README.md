Welcome to the Advanced Python and Container Sessions!

In these two sessions you'll learn some good coding practices for public code, see examples how to publish code/publish a software package, and get a taste of the usefulness of containers.

The main readmes and presentations will be in the respective folders, but here is a short summary:

## Advanced Python <a name="advpy"></a>

Here we'll:

1. Discuss good coding practices, e.g. larger code deployments

2. Discuss how to speed up some basic python code, with an AI generated example

3. How to deploy and maintain public software

Some of the resources used are found in the respective folder and here [GitHub](https://github.com/MeighenBergerS/nu_isance).

## Containers <a name="cont"></a>

Here we'll tackle the basics of:

1. Docker Containers (personal use)

2. Singularity Containers (clusters)

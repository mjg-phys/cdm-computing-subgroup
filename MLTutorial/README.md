# *ML Tutorial Information:*


## ***There are 4 relevant notebooks here:

- [IntroToMachineLearningPresentation.ipynb](link)
- [ExploreLHCDataset.ipynb(link)
- [NNtutorial.ipynb](link)
- [NNtutorial_solutions.ipynb](link)


## IntroToMachineLearningPresentation
The material covered is alot of terminology and definitions used by machine learning enthusiasts. The presentation was completed using a Jupyter Notebook extension called [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html). As such, the notebook has been written in such a way that is optimal for this. Some of the code is very badly written, I might go back and fix this but probably not. I would recommend that people who wish to look at these slides use the "Jupyter-Notebook" extension. Some of the pictures might look squished, but thats due to html/markdown. 

## ExploreLHCDataset
This is plotting the data used in the NNTutorial for visualisation purposes. 

## NNtutorial
This is the tutorial, which goes through Dense Neural Networks. There are 4 different challenges:

0. Lecture Example on Binary Classification 
     - Changing Learning Rate
1. Improving our Neural Network
     - Adding Callbacks
2. Make it predict on all of the different categories
     - Confusion Matrix
3. Regression instead of classification

## NNtutorial_solutions

This is the solutions for the above tutorial
